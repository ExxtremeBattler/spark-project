## Description 
Welcome to Spark! This app is a single-page website that people can use to generate prompts for writing, drawing or coding activities. The aim of the app is to spark creativity in the user.
 


## Installation 
The app will load in any browser, and is hosted at the URL above. The app can be accessed and used on any device.



## Usage 
On visiting the site, the user can see a landing page featuring the prompt types available (Writing, Drawing, Coding). The user can navigate to each prompt type via the nav bar at the top of the page. See below for details of each prompts page. The site also features a contact page linking to the GitHubs of each developer for this project, and to the project repo.

### Writing

The writing page consists of 6 categories the user can have prompts from. Each prompt is generated independently, so a user can select only the ones they want to use by clicking the button featuring that category. Each prompt will be a randomly generated word.

### Drawing

The drawing page challenges the user to draw something from two image prompts within a set time limit. The page first lets the user select their desired time limit, and then when the user clicks the start button two random images are shown and the timer countdown begins. The images are one 'setting' and one 'subject' but the images are randomly generated from a set of pre-chosen words and can be abstract. The images will remain on the page when the timer has finished so the user can continue to use them.

### Coding

The coding prompts page allows the user to select their desired difficulty by clicking one of the option buttons. On clicking, the user is presented with a task to try that matches this difficulty. The user can refresh the page for a new challenge, or use the navbar to go back to the coding prompts landing page to change difficulty. Previous projects that the app has set for the user is also displayed on the page.
